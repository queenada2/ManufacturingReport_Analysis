# ManufacturingReport_Analysis
### This project is a Prescriptive Analysis that gives an insight of the performance and the production yield of a manufacturing company as well as proposes on how to improve the overall equipment efficiency by 20%.
## The Analysis Report answers the following questions:
* The total volume per month, quarter, half year and full year.
* The total hour run, downtime and actual run time per month, quarter, half year and full year.
* The performance of the production line, availability of the machine and OEE per month, quarter, half year and full year.
* Determine which month has the highest production yield and the month with the lowest production yield. Also which quarter has the highest volume of production.
## Report of Analysis
```From the project analysis, it can be observed that Run Time Hours and Downtime has a major impact on Performance and Availability which in turn affects the overall equipment efficiency.```
## Recommendation
```
To improve the overall equipment efficiency by 20%, one has to first improve Performance, Availability and Quality by 20% through
* Predictive maintenance
* Equipment upgrade
* Optimize production schedule and
* Ensure timely and reliable delivery of raw materials and spare parts.
